  The current vision for the system we are building would be in the form of a 
  graphing calculator that not only allows users to access and use various 
  operations, but also provides a GUI interface that will provide a visual 
  representation of graphs of certain functions (such as trigonometry functions 
  and polynomials). The operations will be separated by different sectors in math;
  we will have basic operations, trigonometry operations, probability/statistics 
  operations, calculus operations, and matrix operations.
